Homework 3: Password Generator

This homework consisted of a challenging task to develop a password generator. The password generator asks the user questions first like their prefered password length, whether they want to use lower case or upper case letters, and whether or not they want to utilize numbers and/or special characters. After criteria is established, the password appears in the text box on the page.

My password generator processes the user's responses and creates a password accordingly. Overall, I think this exercise was helpful to consider how javascript can play a role in creating a real tool that people can apply to their lives.
